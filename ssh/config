# Example of how I manage multiple accounts on one machine, above are example setups and files.
#
# In $HOME, have a `.gitconfig` file which will look like the following:
# The user info here will be associated with whatever will be the main account.
# [user]
#   name = Grimm
#   email = grimm@grimm.com
#
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Developer/personal/"]
#   path = ~/Developer/personal/.gitconfig
#
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Developer/grimm/"]
#   path = ~/Developer/grimm/.gitconfig
#
# [includeIf "gitdir:~/Developer/work/"]
#   path = ~/Developer/work/.gitconfig 
#
# I use a Developer directory in home to hold all my projects (or would be projects)
# So in Developer/{account} make a `.gitconfig`, which will have the user info associated with that account
# E.g: `~/Developer/grimm/.gitconfig`:
# [user]
#   name = Grimm 
#   email = grimm@grimm.com 
#
# And so on for each account, 
# BE SURE TO RUN THIS WHEN IN AN ACCOUNT DIRECTORY:
# `ssh-add ~/.ssh/GITHUB_ACCOUNT_SSHKEY_FILE`
#
# And when pulling from your repo you'll add the -work or -personal to the url 
# for instance:
# git@github.com-work:{user}/{repo}.git
